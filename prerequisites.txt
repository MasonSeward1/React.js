MongoDB must have a db named "CP3010Project". Capitalization is important.
The DB must have 3 collections:
	1. ClientData -> can be left empty as the application will insert default values for a new player
	2. wordOfDay -> can be left empty as the application inserts a word for the day upon launch.
	3. words -> a collection of words which are json's containing an id and a word. This is the collection which a random word will be selected from
		and inserted into wordOfDay. A "words.json" file is contained within the same root as this note and contains words in the correct format. It can be used, or
		custom words can be imported.
